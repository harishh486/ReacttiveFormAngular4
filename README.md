##  Reactive form Handling

 We need to link the reactive form i.e we need to tell angular that do not create any form jus use this form that i created here.(signupForm)
 onSubmit directive is the one which is going to submit the form.
 
 Inorder to register the control elements of the input use this formControlName.
 
formGroup, formGroupName, formArrayName,formControlName all these directives tell that  please register the input elements with the form created in the type script.

Asynchronous form handling.

Used Validators and also custom build validators and added  to the templates.
